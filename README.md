## Code Description

The Food Card Creator is a simple web application that allows users to create and display food cards with images, names, descriptions, and ranks. Users can fill out a form with the details of the food item they want to add, and upon submission, a new card is generated and displayed on the page.

## Things you did in the code
1. Add Food Cards: Users can input the name, description, image URL, and rank of a food item and create a corresponding card.
2. Delete Food Cards: Each card includes a delete button that allows users to remove it from the display.
3. Rank Validation: The application ensures that each food item has a unique rank, preventing duplicates.

## Challenges encountered
Alignment and Interactivity: Ensuring that the layout and alignment of elements in the CSS matched the dynamic interactivity added by the JavaScript was a significant challenge. As new food cards were added and deleted dynamically, it was crucial to maintain a consistent and visually appealing layout.

## Commit Log
